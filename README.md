# CSS3-Fancy-Buttons
10 buttons were created and they are divided into 5 groups. 

GROUP 1- Facebook Buttons
  I learnt how to replicate the blue and grey themed buttons from Facebook. The buttons are responsive when you hover on them and click     them. The hover and active states of the buttons change the color of the buttons slightly. I used mainly box-shadow and text-shadow to     create these buttons

GROUP 2- 3D Buttons
  I learnt how to make buttons that look like they are popping out of their background. These buttons are respnsive when you hover and       click on them. The hover state changes the color slightly while the active state looks like you are pressing the buttons down into the     page. I used multiple box-shadows and color changes to create the 3D effect. And to create the effect of pressing the buttons down, I     had to adjust the padding calculations. 
  
GROUP 3- Gradient Buttons
  I learnt how to make responsive gradient buttons. When you see them at first, only the borders are gradients and when you hover, the       whole background of the button is a gradient. I used border/background image to create the gradient and then I used transition to         create the gradient effect. 

GROUP 4- Animated Buttons
  I learnt how to make animated buttons. The first button has a background image which when hovered on, animates the image from left to     right of the button. The second button looks ordinary at first but when hovered on, the original text is animated from right to left and   a new text is "introduced in the button". To make both buttons, I leant how to use the animation keyword together with @keyframes and I   also used transition and opacity to "hide" the "new text". The second button was made possible using opacity and padding calculations.
  
GROUP 5- Toggle Key Button
  These buttons are checkboxes rather than buttons and they are responsive when checked. When checked, they change colors and/or content. These responsive checkboxes were made possible by using the adjacent sibling selector to access the look of the button when it is checked.
